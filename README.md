# SublimeBrainfuck

This plugin provides Brainfuck language support for Sublime Text.
Currently I only support Sublime Text 2 (which shall change in the near future).

As this is my first Sublime plugin I'll have to experiment a bit to get everything working.
For now it is only a syntax definition but I plan in integrating an interpreter as well.
